So how do we add GitHub Copilot to VS Code. 

1﻿) Go sign up for GitHub Copilot - https://github.com/features/copilot\
I﻿t's not free, but it does have a 2 month free trial (At least at the time I'm making this), and when you do start paying for it it's only $10/month (Or $100 a year. You get $20 off if you pre pay for a year).

2﻿) Once you're all signed up for Copilot on GitHub, it's time to move over to VS Code. You'll just open the 'extensions' and search for 'GitHub Copilot'. The first one that comes up will most likely be the correct one, but here's a screenshot for reference.

Just click the blue 'install' button and it will add it to your VS Code. Once it's installed, if you're not already signed into GitHub via VS Code, you'll be prompted to connect your GitHub to access Copilot. 

C﻿ongrats! You've now got GitHub Copilot connected to your VS Code. Now as you're writing code Copilot is going to suggest autocompletions. If what it suggests looks good, just press tab to add it. 

I﻿f you've got any other questions feel free to let me know and I'll talk to you in the next one.
